    <p className='ml-20 text-xl'>The Grandma K Games were made to celebrate the best grandmother in the world. Our grandmother is very near & dear to our hearts, and I know our family will always continue to support her through the challenges of Alzeheimers diseease.
      While maybe we cannot stop the Alzeheimers all together, it certainly doesnt mean we can't do our part to help slow it down.
      The Grandma K Games, look to do just that through fun brain exercises, family trivia, and a few different games. The whole family can play along with grandma whenever they get the chance to go visit.
      I hope these silly little games can maybe help her recall all the amazing memories our family has had, and bring a smile to her face in the process. A smile I cannot wait to see soon!
